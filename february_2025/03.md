# Gosh I hate Monday mornings
Typical monday morning. Didn't wake up feeling tired today. Not that I had a lot of sleep
but I had just enough. Should be a chill day, hope I will get done with work soon enough
to work on my own projects and study.

I'm about to head to bed. Today was pretty chill. I noticed that I wasn't tired during the
day. Couldn't workout, but tomorrow I will definitely do. I need to better plan my days.
